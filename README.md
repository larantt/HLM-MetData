# HLM-MetData
Requirements
-------------
python 3.14, herbie, numpy, xarray and backends.
It is probably best to just clone the environment I used to develop this. I have
tested it locally [and on a Tiger login node] and it seems to work fine.

```
conda env create -f met_downloader.yml
conda activate met_downloader
```
